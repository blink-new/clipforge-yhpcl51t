      Welcome everyone to today's discussion about artificial intelligence and its impact on society.
      I want to share three mind-blowing facts about AI that will change how you think about technology.
      First, did you know that AI can now create art that's indistinguishable from human work?
      Second, machine learning algorithms are already making decisions that affect millions of people daily.
      Third, the next breakthrough in AI could happen tomorrow, and we might not even realize it.
      These developments are happening faster than most people understand.
      The implications for jobs, creativity, and human connection are profound.
      But here's what really excites me about the future of AI...
